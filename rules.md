# The Rules

## Gameplay
There need to be exactly 5 players to play.

At the beginning of the game, each player is given an alias and assigned one target to kill. Everyone is given a different target, and no two people can be targeting eachother.

The goal of the game is to successfully kill your target, or kill the person who is targeting you. But there's a catch: in order to kill another player, you need to convince someone else to help you attack them.

Each game will continue until at least one player dies.

## Turns
At the beginning of each turn, every player is given 4 action points that they can use to make moves. These points do not carry over between turns, so if you don't use all of them, they are gone forever.

You can spend your action points on any combination of the following 4 moves:

After all players have locked in their moves, the moves are executed simultaneously.

All messages will be delivered to the corresponding players at the start of the next turn.
